This can lead to a longer duration of ART treatment and fewer gaps in ART treatment.\nWith ADAP, individuals who are on T2 may be able to obtain ART treatment and engage in care.\nIn addition, individual attributes influence the probability that a person diagnosed with HIV enrolls in ADAP.\n\nIn addition to being assigned a trajectory upon model entry, individuals are also assigned \"ADAP\" or \"no ADAP\", Only these people may enter the ADAP program.\nThe trajectory and ADAP/no ADAP assignment is illustrated below:\n\n\nParameters\nnote: VS = viral suppression\n\n\n    Label\n    Parameter\n    Data Source\n    Stratification\n    Question\n\n\nTreatment trajectories\n\n\n    tt4\n     Percentage of PLWH who consistently achieve full VS \n     MMP, eHARS \n     Race, income, insurance, region\n     ?
