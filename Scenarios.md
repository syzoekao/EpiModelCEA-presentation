# Program Scenarios to be Modeled

## Outcomes for all scenarios:
  - ADAP program size and cost
  - PDAP program size and cost
  - number of new HIV infections
  - HIV+ care continuum
  - PrEP care continuum

## Scenarios

0. **Status quo**.
  - keep PDAP size the same
  - keep ADAP coverage the same
1. **Increase PDAP Program Size**
  - for example, from 600 to 2000 people
  - re-calibrate enrollment probability
  - examine any effects on ADAP
2. **Increase ADAP coverage**
  - for example, increase the percentage of eligibles who are enrolled
  from 50% (hypothetically) to 70%
3. **Increase pool of those eligible for ADAP**
  - for example, increasing income cutoff from 400% to 500% FPL
4. **Combinations**
  - combine variations of 1, 2, and 3
5. **Others?**
